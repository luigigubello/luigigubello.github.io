										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some days ago the journalist Charlotte Godart contacted me and asked me to explain how to use my script <a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/My-Twitter-World/tree/master/tweets-analysis"><strong>tweet_analysis.py</strong></a>. Her goal was to convert Twitter datasets about Chinese propaganda into graphs, so that people can see how the Chinese government operates on Twitter to influence their opinion. While helping her I had the possibility to take a look at these datasets and they are intriguing, very different from the Internet Research Agency dataset. My <em>unconfirmed</em> theory is that the Chinese government bought some bots and fake accounts from third-party companies. China has a strong power on national internet services such as TikTok or WeChat (e.g. filters, censorship), not so much on external services, though, for now. I think this situation will change quickly.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A GLOBAL VIEW</h4>
<p>I merged the three datasets shared by Twitter in order to have a global view of the accounts&#8217; activity. So, in the three datasets there are <strong>over 13 milion tweets</strong> and <strong>over 5.000 accounts</strong>, but the accounts suspended by Twitter are many more. I used the command:</p>
<p><code>python3 tweets_analysis.py --dirpath alldata -w -top -csv -txt -v</code></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1024" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet.png 1446w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-300x229.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-768x587.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-1024x783.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /><br />
The most intensive activity took place during the first and last quarter of 2016, the second quarter of 2017 and the first semester of 2019. To better understand these datasets it is important to notice that not all these accounts were used to spread pro-China propaganda, many of them were only spam bots. The reason why Twitter has suspended them all is &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; that the <strong>people behind these networks, both spam bots and pro-China accounts, are the same.</strong> The graph also shows that these accounts generated more tweets than retweets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag.png" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag.png 1280w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-300x225.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-768x576.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-920x690.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>This wordcloud graph shows the 100 most frequent hashtags and it gives an idea of the hottest topics. The wordcloud confirms that many suspended accounts are part of a spam network: the hashtags <strong>#OpenFollow, #AutoFreeFollowers, #FollowMe </strong>or<strong> #TeamFollowBack</strong> are used to get more followers and they are the most frequent. The hashtag <strong>#HongKong</strong> is also very popular, it was used in <strong>31.677</strong> tweets. Below I will explain why, because it is very interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user.png" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user.png 1280w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-300x225.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-768x576.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-920x690.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The wordcloud of the most retweeted users seems to confirm the previous one: many accounts are bots used to amplify tweets, and some of them were suspended by Twitter. Often Twitter suspends accounts that are retweeted by bots, although they aren&#8217;t in the dataset. There are other two important graphs about this giant dataset shared by Twitter: the barplots of the most used languages and the most used clients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent.png 1261w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-300x223.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-768x572.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-1024x763.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p>In the dataset there are many tweets posted on Android or iPhone, which is difficult to explain. However, if these accouts are part of a sophisticated spam-bots network, it is possible that a large number of people worked behind these accounts. Then, a single person could manage multiple accounts on different phones. It is nothing new, bots factories are a thing. Another hypothesis is that many accounts were created to be sold: the company created the accounts, increased their followers, then sold them. However, the clients information can be easily abused to deceive others (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dorothy-fridge-tweets">just remembering #FreeDorothy story</a>).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language.png 1261w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-300x223.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-768x572.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-1024x763.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p>In this graph &#8211; the barplot of the most frequent languages &#8211; we can see that most of the tweets are written in <strong>Indonesian</strong>, if data are correct, then come <strong>English</strong>, <strong>Chinese</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>. A hypothesis for this fact is that this network &#8211; or networks &#8211; was targeting the Indonesian market and, perhaps, also the agency -the agencies &#8211; behind these accounts are Indonesian. My guess is that <strong>there are some Indonesian agents behind Chinese propaganda on Hong Kong protests</strong>, which is why Twitter wrote &#8220;<em>state-backed information operation</em>&#8220;. The last graph about the three datasets shared by Twitter regards the volume of interactions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions.png 1446w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-300x229.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-768x587.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-1024x783.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /></p>
<p>I really cannot explain the spike of hearts during 2019. My best guess is that some tweets became viral without a particular reason, like porn contents. I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/evaristegal0is/status/1179373159780421642?s=19">a thread on Twitter</a> some time ago.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CHINESE TWEETS</h4>
<p>Now I will focus on tweets written in Chinese, that can only be read by Chinese-speaking people. This time I used the command:</p>
<p><code>python3 tweets_analysis.py --dirpath alldata --tlang zh -csv -txt -v</code></p>
<p>So I can see only data about Chinese (<strong>zh</strong>) tweets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet.png" alt="" width="1424" height="1105" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet.png 1424w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-300x233.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-768x596.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-1024x795.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-1420x1102.png 1420w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-920x714.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Chinese tweets are less than a million</strong>, not so many if compared with <strong>English</strong> tweets (<strong>~ 2,5 millions</strong>) or <strong>Indonesian</strong> tweets (<strong>~ 4 milions</strong>). The volume growth is interesting: there is a spike in October 2017 and there is a fast growth between October 2018 and July 2019, with two strong spikes in April and July. The <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall"><strong>ASPI&#8217;s study</strong></a> shows how, in the dataset #1 and #2, there are conspiracy tweets targeting anti-government opponents, which may be a first attempt to influence the online opinion. Also, in the dataset #3 there is a high volume, during 2019, that coincides with Hong Kong protests&#8217; period. The most frequent hashtag is <strong>#香港</strong>, which means &#8220;<em>Hong Kong</em>&#8220;, while the second one is <strong>#HongKong</strong>, used in 31.677 tweets. 29.866 of these are classified as Chinese (<em>zh</em>). The third most popular hashtag is <strong>#HK</strong>. Almost every tweet about Hong Kong is written in Chinese, they are probably targeting Chinese people, especially who lives overseas, because Twitter is blocked in China. Another interesting fact regards the retweeted accounts, I haven&#8217;t checked every single one but it seems that <em>they have all been suspended by Twitter, even if they were only retweeted once and they aren&#8217;t present in the dataset</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions.png 1446w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-300x229.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-768x587.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-1024x783.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /></p>
<p>These tweets have generated a peculiar graph of interactions: there is a huge spike in the replies, which is uncommon, and I cannot tell whether the accounts who replied to Chinese bots are humans, bots or both. However, the propaganda has not generated many retweets or hearts, so they haven&#8217;t become viral like Internet Research Agency contents. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t understand Chinese, so I can&#8217;t see the tweets&#8217; contents. The two last graphs show the coordinated behavior of these account:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent.png 1261w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-300x223.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-768x572.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-1024x763.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density.png" alt="" width="1685" height="907" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density.png 1685w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-300x161.png 300w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-768x413.png 768w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-1024x551.png 1024w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-1420x764.png 1420w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-920x495.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1685px) 100vw, 1685px" /></p>
<p>The most used clients are Twitter Web Client (browser) and FTTT. They are easily &#8220;hackable&#8221; and are often used to automate the accounts. This inauthentic behavior seems to be confirmed by the daily rhythm: most of Chinese tweets are mainly published <strong>between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.</strong> (local time) <strong>during the work week</strong>, the same pattern can be also noticed during the weekend, but there is a lower volume. In my opinion this pattern is a weak and failed attempt by the malicious agents to simulate a natural and human behavior.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>I have written <strong><a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/My-Twitter-World/tree/master/tweets-analysis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweet_analysis.py</a></strong> to help people who want to read and understand the datasets shared by Twitter. This script creates graphs and shows some information in a &#8220;human-friendly&#8221; way. My main difficult with these datasets has been the language: I don&#8217;t know Chinese, so I cannot read tweets and Google Translate doesn&#8217;t work very well with Chinese. However, these graphs raise many interesting points: the Internet Research Agency propaganda was based on microtargeting and well planned, there were many groups of trolls with different features to reach different people, while Chinese propaganda is &#8220;young&#8221;, maybe it has been commissioned to private companies, I cannot see a well-planned strategy like the Russian one. These data are important because they acknowledge that China wants to be a player in this game, also outside its borders &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise &#8211; and they also confirm that Twitter is still important to share information, reach the journalists quickly and lead protests. I want to thank <strong>Niccolò Battolla</strong> who is helping me to improve my script, I hope I will add some more features soon. You can find the graphs and data of this post on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yq1ks4x0zs1ea16/AAAU8Tn1fxVTdxpH4HJBUm51a?dl=0">my Dropbox</a>.</p>

<p>Mi sono quindi domandato se c&#8217;è un modo veloce per filtrare gli utenti di Twitter in base alla presenza, o meno, di una determinata emoji nel loro nickname. La risposta è <strong>Sì</strong>, bastano qualche riga di Python e l&#8217;utilizzo delle API di Twitter. A questo punto ho deciso di giocare un po&#8217; di più con Python e le API di Twitter, provando a vedere se era possibile rispondere a qualche domanda, utilizzando i dati ottenibili tramite le API. Le domande che mi sono posto sono principalmente due:</p>

<li>In che percentuale gli utenti con <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname, ma che <strong>non </strong>hanno le seguenti emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname, seguono <u>attivamente</u> i principali politici italiani?</li>
<li>Viceversa, in che percentuale gli utenti con <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname seguono <u>attivamente</u> i principali politici italiani?</li>
</ul>
<p>Chiarisco una questione: questa <strong>non</strong> è un&#8217;analisi scientifica. È solo un esercizio, l&#8217;utilizzo delle API di Twitter tramite il linguaggio Python. Twitter impone delle limitazioni all&#8217;utilizzo delle API nella modalità Free, ad esempio limitando fortemente il numero di dati che si possono ottenere, ma permette di utilizzarli, seppur in maniera limitata, e questo basta per capire come funzionano e per giocarci un po&#8217;. Tornando alle due domande poste sopra, per &#8220;attivamente&#8221; intendo account Twitter che interagiscono, quindi mi sono interessato a tutti quegli utenti che interagiscono retweetando un tweet di un determinato politico. Per &#8220;principali politici&#8221; invece ho deciso di prendere in considerazione i leader dei principali partiti che erano presenti alle elezioni del 4 marzo, quindi: Pietro Grasso, Emma Bonino, Matteo Renzi, Luigi Di Maio, Silvio Berlusconi, Matteo Salvini e Giorgia Meloni. A questi nomi ho aggiunto anche Beppe Grillo, in quanto fondatore e garante del Movimento 5 Stelle, e Paolo Gentiloni, in quanto Presidente del Consiglio in carica prima delle elezioni del 4 marzo.</p>
<p>A questo punto è bastato scrivere un codice Python che, tramite le API di  Twitter, facesse questo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creare una lista con gli ultimi 25 tweet postati da un account, escluse le risposte e i retweet</li>
<li>Per ogni tweet presente nella lista, selezionare al più 100 utenti che hanno retweetato il tweet e controllare se hanno determinate emoji nel nickname</li>
<li>Tenere conto del numero di utenti con determinate emoji nel nickname per poi riportare i dati in un grafico</li>
</ul>
<p>Il limite di &#8220;al più 100 utenti che hanno retweetato&#8221; è uno di quei limiti imposti da Twitter nell&#8217;utilizzo gratuito delle API. Tra l&#8217;altro non seleziona mai cento utenti, ma per qualche motivo si limita a circa una novantina (mi sono domandato il perché, ma non ho approfondito per ora). Il codice che ho scritto lo potete trovare su <a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/analisi_emoji/blob/master/analisi_bandiera.py">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I risultati sono interessanti: gli utenti che hanno <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname, ma che <strong>non </strong>hanno <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname, interagiscono (tramite retweet) principalmente con gli account di Matteo Salvini, Giorgia Meloni e Luigi Di Maio. Per essere più precisi, tra gli utenti che hanno retweetato gli ultimi 25 tweet di Matteo Salvini mediamente il <strong>15,70% </strong>aveva l&#8217;emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname. Per Giorgia Meloni la percentuale è invece del <strong>12,58%</strong> e per Luigi Di Maio è del <strong>7,33%</strong>.<br />
Questi tre profili sono anche quelli con cui gli utenti che hanno almeno una tra le emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname interagiscono di meno: per Matteo Salvini la percentuale è <strong>0,20%</strong>, per Giorgia Meloni è <strong>0,12%</strong> e per Luigi Di Maio è <strong>0,16%</strong>.</p>
<p>Gli utenti con <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname interagiscono prevalentemente con gli account di Emma Bonino, Paolo Gentiloni e Matteo Renzi, anche se con percentuali minori se confrontate agli utenti con l&#8217;emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> che interagiscono con gli altri tre leader. Emma Bonino ottiene una percentuale di <strong>9,41%</strong>, mentre Paolo Gentiloni e Matteo Renzi ottengono una percentuale di <strong>5,29%</strong> e <strong>4,91%</strong> rispettivamente. In maniera antisimmetrica, gli utenti con <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname non sembrano interagire (tramite retweet) con questi tre leader: infatti per tutti e tre la percentuale è inferiore a <strong>1%</strong>.</p>
<p>L&#8217;account di Beppe Grillo ottiene percentuali simili a quelle di Matteo Renzi, ma ad utenti invertiti: gli utenti che hanno <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png" alt="🇮🇹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> nel nickname sono mediamente il <strong>4,12%</strong> di quelli che hanno retweetato i tweet di Beppe Grillo, mentre gli utenti con le emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308.png" alt="🏳️‍🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> / <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f308.png" alt="🌈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> sono mediamente un irrisorio <strong>0,04%</strong>, praticamente assenti. Per quanto riguarda gli account di Silvio Berlusconi e Pietro Grasso, entrambi i gruppi di utenti sembrano interagire poco con questi account.</p>
<p>Un riassunto dei risultati, con i relativi grafici, lo potete trovare in questo <a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/analisi_emoji/blob/master/analisi.pdf">file pdf</a>. Ci tengo ora ad elencare i limiti di questa &#8220;analisi&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Le percentuali sono solo proiezioni ottenute da un campione piuttosto piccolo</li>
<li>Non sono stati presi in considerazione il numero di followers e la viralità dei tweet analizzati</li>
<li>I 25 tweet presi come campione coprono un arco temporale differente per ogni account</li>
<li>Non è stato fatto nessun controllo sugli account che retweetavano, per capire ad esempio se si trattava di account poco attendibili</li>
<li>Le API gratuite di Twitter limitano fortemente la quantità di dati analizzabile</li>
<li>I risultati riguardano solo gli account analizzati, e non si possono generalizzare</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonostante i limiti del codice da me scritto e delle API di Twitter, sugli account presi in considerazione sembra crearsi una polarizzazione: se escludiamo gli account di Silvio Berlusconi e Pietro Grasso, che hanno basse percentuali per entrambi i gruppi di persone, per gli altri account <u>sembra</u> delinearsi il fatto che la presenza di un gruppo esclude la presenza dell&#8217;altro.</p>
<p>I dati sono stati calcolati tutti nella notte del 19 luglio 2018, nella speranza di rendere un po&#8217; omogenea questa &#8220;analisi&#8221;. È facile che queste percentuali mutino velocemente nel tempo, per diversi fattori.</p>
<p>P.S. So che il titolo non è dei migliori, ma non ho saputo fare di meglio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my own spare time I like to participate in the bug bounty programs. They are a hard challenge, but it is satisfying to find vulnerabilities in big companies.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" src="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xsssonar_logo.png" alt="XSSSonar" width="481" height="243" srcset="https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xsssonar_logo.png 481w, https://www.gubello.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xsssonar_logo-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p><strong>XSSSonar</strong> is an open source tool to look for XSS vulnerabilities on a web page, it is written in Python 2.x for now, but I hope to rewrite it in Python 3.x. You can download it from the <a href="https://www.github.com/luigigubello/XSSSonar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>A little trick to properly use XSSSonar with POST parameters: in the source code of the site you find the HTML tag <strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> where the POST parameters are and check if there is the attribute <strong>action</strong>. If so, the value of attribute is the URL to type in XSSSonar. It is better to assign default values to POST parameters to have a more precise scan.</p>
