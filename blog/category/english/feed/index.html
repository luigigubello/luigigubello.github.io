								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy is facing dark days because of coronavirus and there is a lot of disinformation about this topic, especially on messaging apps and social networks (the journalist Jane Lytvynenko is <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneLytv/status/1239552819184766977">collecting and debunking</a> a large number of fake news about COVID-19). Last week (<strong>03/12</strong>) China sent a team of doctors and equipment for Italian hospitals, a part of which Italy will pay for. The Chinese Embassy in Italy reported the news on Twitter and – during these particular days – their Twitter account is particular active. Their tweets have generated many retweets, likes and positive replies – many thanks from Italian people – because coronavirus is a world issue and people are scared. This is the bright side of it, but there is another side: many tweets and reactions seem to have been created by bots or suspicious accounts, usually with few tweets, no profile pic, absolutely pro Chinese government and anti USA. If you try to reply in a negative way to the Chinese Embassy in Italy (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/AmbCina">@AmbCina</a>), you will probably receive this message from some users: <strong>nmsl</strong>, Chinese slang that stands for “<em>Your mom is dead</em>”<em>.</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_1057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1057" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1057" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Schermata-del-2020-03-16-01-43-30.png" alt="" width="485" height="820" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Schermata-del-2020-03-16-01-43-30.png 537w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Schermata-del-2020-03-16-01-43-30-177x300.png 177w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1057" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;nmsl&#8221; replies under Chinese Embassy&#8217;s tweets</figcaption></figure>
<p>I monitored the retweets of this Chinese Embassy&#8217;s tweet:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></center><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
and I found some suspicious accounts, but at first I didn&#8217;t give them importance:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1065" style="width: 1602px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1065 size-full" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account.png" alt="" width="1602" height="592" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account.png 1602w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-300x111.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-1024x378.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-768x284.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-1536x568.png 1536w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-1420x525.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/primo_account-920x340.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1602px) 100vw, 1602px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1065" class="wp-caption-text">e.g. three strange accounts</figcaption></figure>

<p>Taking a better look at the reactions to @AmbCina&#8217;s tweets and the replies, I noticed other weird numbers and accounts:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1068" style="width: 1134px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1068" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251.png" alt="" width="1134" height="768" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251.png 1134w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251-300x203.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251-1024x694.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251-768x520.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/251-920x623.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1068" class="wp-caption-text">An user replies to @AmbCina with a tweet against Chinese gov: they receive 139 replies and a &#8220;pro-Chinese government&#8221; reply receives 251 likes.</figcaption></figure>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">HOW DO THESE ACCOUNTS ACT?</h3>
<p>Usually they don’t write tweets and don’t retweet, someone give some replies, usually replies are insults against China opponents’ tweets or against the USA, but their main activity is <strong>to boost </strong>pro-China tweets by liking them. This especially happens with tweets that are about One-China policy (against Hong Kong protests) or give a <em>different story-telling about coronavirus where China has no faults, or, in general, if they give a positive outlook on Chinese government</em>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1070" style="width: 2180px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1070" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like.png" alt="" width="2180" height="929" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like.png 2180w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-300x128.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-1024x436.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-768x327.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-1536x655.png 1536w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-2048x873.png 2048w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-1420x605.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/like-920x392.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 2180px) 100vw, 2180px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1070" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Default&#8221; users who like tweets pro-China</figcaption></figure>

<p>They seem to follow a scheme, but I cannot know if they are bots – probably “<em>human-bots</em>” – or only nationalist people because – obviously – I cannot view their IP addresses.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1077" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1077" style="width: 1659px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1077" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts.png" alt="" width="1659" height="1764" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts.png 1659w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-282x300.png 282w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-963x1024.png 963w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-768x817.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-1445x1536.png 1445w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-1420x1510.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/allaccounts-920x978.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1659px) 100vw, 1659px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1077" class="wp-caption-text">Some examples</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, by searching “<em>nmsl</em>” you can find many similar accounts that reply to China opponents, especially if the negative tweets are replies to government accounts (e.g. see <strong>@AmbCina</strong> or <strong>@zlj517</strong>, Chinese Foreign Ministry), so it seems to be a worldwide trend. I don&#8217;t and cannot know whether the Chinese government is trying to manipulate public opinion on Twitter and to create a positive story-telling about government’s choices, but all these accounts seem to behave in a coordinate way. Only Twitter can really investigate on them, and I hope they are doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2020/03/18):</strong> Twitter are apparently limiting and suspending some accounts.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During last spring (2019) I started to &#8220;open and read&#8221; the Android applications before installing them. Reversing an APK file can be interesting to understand how an app works, how it manages the permissions and my data, if there are vulnerabilities. I was looking for a different Android mail client, so I started to reverse them and I found many mail clients on Play Store were &#8211; maybe are &#8211; vulnerable to Javascript injection. I found eight important apps vulnerable to cross-site scripting:<strong> Newton Mail</strong> 10.0.23, <strong>Nine Email</strong> 4.5.3a, <strong>Blue Mail</strong> 1.9.5.36, <strong>Edison Email</strong> 1.7.1, <strong>Email TypeApp</strong> 1.9.5.35 and <strong>Spark</strong> 2.0.2 + <strong>two</strong> apps I can&#8217;t disclose now. In April and May 2019 I wrote to vendors of these apps, but only someone replied to me.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">JAVASCRIPT INJECTION IN ANDROID WEBVIEW</h3>
<p>Javascript injection in Android WebView is a serious vulnerability because in some scenario it was possible to execute code remotely by injecting a malicious Javascript code in the WebView (<strong>CVE-2012-6636</strong>, <strong>CVE-2013-4710</strong>). These vulnerabilities were fixed by Google, but Javascript injection in the WebView is yet a common bug, also for this reason Google have created <a href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9095419?hl=en-GB">a support page</a> to explain how to use Javascript interfaces in the WebView. Although Javascript injection usually doesn&#8217;t lead to code execution, it is still a serious vulnerability <a href="https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/review-android-webviews-fileaccess-attack-vectors/index.html">because can be used to steal data</a> (similar to CVE-2019-11730 PoC) if <code dir="ltr" translate="no">setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs</code> is set <code>True</code>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some days ago the journalist Charlotte Godart contacted me and asked me to explain how to use my script <a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/My-Twitter-World/tree/master/tweets-analysis"><strong>tweet_analysis.py</strong></a>. Her goal was to convert Twitter datasets about Chinese propaganda into graphs, so that people can see how the Chinese government operates on Twitter to influence their opinion. While helping her I had the possibility to take a look at these datasets and they are intriguing, very different from the Internet Research Agency dataset. My <em>unconfirmed</em> theory is that the Chinese government bought some bots and fake accounts from third-party companies. China has a strong power on national internet services such as TikTok or WeChat (e.g. filters, censorship), not so much on external services, though, for now. I think this situation will change quickly.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A GLOBAL VIEW</h4>
<p>I merged the three datasets shared by Twitter in order to have a global view of the accounts&#8217; activity. So, in the three datasets there are <strong>over 13 milion tweets</strong> and <strong>over 5.000 accounts</strong>, but the accounts suspended by Twitter are many more. I used the command:</p>
<p><code>python3 tweets_analysis.py --dirpath alldata -w -top -csv -txt -v</code></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1024" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet.png 1446w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-300x229.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-768x587.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-1024x783.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_tweet-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /><br />
The most intensive activity took place during the first and last quarter of 2016, the second quarter of 2017 and the first semester of 2019. To better understand these datasets it is important to notice that not all these accounts were used to spread pro-China propaganda, many of them were only spam bots. The reason why Twitter has suspended them all is &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; that the <strong>people behind these networks, both spam bots and pro-China accounts, are the same.</strong> The graph also shows that these accounts generated more tweets than retweets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag.png" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag.png 1280w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_hashtag-920x690.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>This wordcloud graph shows the 100 most frequent hashtags and it gives an idea of the hottest topics. The wordcloud confirms that many suspended accounts are part of a spam network: the hashtags <strong>#OpenFollow, #AutoFreeFollowers, #FollowMe </strong>or<strong> #TeamFollowBack</strong> are used to get more followers and they are the most frequent. The hashtag <strong>#HongKong</strong> is also very popular, it was used in <strong>31.677</strong> tweets. Below I will explain why, because it is very interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user.png" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user.png 1280w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_retweeted_user-920x690.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The wordcloud of the most retweeted users seems to confirm the previous one: many accounts are bots used to amplify tweets, and some of them were suspended by Twitter. Often Twitter suspends accounts that are retweeted by bots, although they aren&#8217;t in the dataset. There are other two important graphs about this giant dataset shared by Twitter: the barplots of the most used languages and the most used clients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent.png 1261w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-300x223.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-768x572.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-1024x763.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_user_agent-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p>In the dataset there are many tweets posted on Android or iPhone, which is difficult to explain. However, if these accouts are part of a sophisticated spam-bots network, it is possible that a large number of people worked behind these accounts. Then, a single person could manage multiple accounts on different phones. It is nothing new, bots factories are a thing. Another hypothesis is that many accounts were created to be sold: the company created the accounts, increased their followers, then sold them. However, the clients information can be easily abused to deceive others (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dorothy-fridge-tweets">just remembering #FreeDorothy story</a>).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language.png 1261w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-300x223.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-768x572.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-1024x763.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_tweets_language-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p>In this graph &#8211; the barplot of the most frequent languages &#8211; we can see that most of the tweets are written in <strong>Indonesian</strong>, if data are correct, then come <strong>English</strong>, <strong>Chinese</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>. A hypothesis for this fact is that this network &#8211; or networks &#8211; was targeting the Indonesian market and, perhaps, also the agency -the agencies &#8211; behind these accounts are Indonesian. My guess is that <strong>there are some Indonesian agents behind Chinese propaganda on Hong Kong protests</strong>, which is why Twitter wrote &#8220;<em>state-backed information operation</em>&#8220;. The last graph about the three datasets shared by Twitter regards the volume of interactions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions.png 1446w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-300x229.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-768x587.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-1024x783.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/all_volume_interactions-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /></p>
<p>I really cannot explain the spike of hearts during 2019. My best guess is that some tweets became viral without a particular reason, like porn contents. I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/evaristegal0is/status/1179373159780421642?s=19">a thread on Twitter</a> some time ago.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CHINESE TWEETS</h4>
<p>Now I will focus on tweets written in Chinese, that can only be read by Chinese-speaking people. This time I used the command:</p>
<p><code>python3 tweets_analysis.py --dirpath alldata --tlang zh -csv -txt -v</code></p>
<p>So I can see only data about Chinese (<strong>zh</strong>) tweets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet.png" alt="" width="1424" height="1105" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet.png 1424w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-300x233.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-768x596.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-1024x795.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-1420x1102.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_tweet-920x714.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Chinese tweets are less than a million</strong>, not so many if compared with <strong>English</strong> tweets (<strong>~ 2,5 millions</strong>) or <strong>Indonesian</strong> tweets (<strong>~ 4 milions</strong>). The volume growth is interesting: there is a spike in October 2017 and there is a fast growth between October 2018 and July 2019, with two strong spikes in April and July. The <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall"><strong>ASPI&#8217;s study</strong></a> shows how, in the dataset #1 and #2, there are conspiracy tweets targeting anti-government opponents, which may be a first attempt to influence the online opinion. Also, in the dataset #3 there is a high volume, during 2019, that coincides with Hong Kong protests&#8217; period. The most frequent hashtag is <strong>#香港</strong>, which means &#8220;<em>Hong Kong</em>&#8220;, while the second one is <strong>#HongKong</strong>, used in 31.677 tweets. 29.866 of these are classified as Chinese (<em>zh</em>). The third most popular hashtag is <strong>#HK</strong>. Almost every tweet about Hong Kong is written in Chinese, they are probably targeting Chinese people, especially who lives overseas, because Twitter is blocked in China. Another interesting fact regards the retweeted accounts, I haven&#8217;t checked every single one but it seems that <em>they have all been suspended by Twitter, even if they were only retweeted once and they aren&#8217;t present in the dataset</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions.png" alt="" width="1446" height="1105" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions.png 1446w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-300x229.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-768x587.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-1024x783.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-1420x1085.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_volume_interactions-920x703.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1446px) 100vw, 1446px" /></p>
<p>These tweets have generated a peculiar graph of interactions: there is a huge spike in the replies, which is uncommon, and I cannot tell whether the accounts who replied to Chinese bots are humans, bots or both. However, the propaganda has not generated many retweets or hearts, so they haven&#8217;t become viral like Internet Research Agency contents. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t understand Chinese, so I can&#8217;t see the tweets&#8217; contents. The two last graphs show the coordinated behavior of these account:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent.png" alt="" width="1261" height="939" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent.png 1261w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-300x223.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-768x572.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-1024x763.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_user_agent-920x685.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density.png" alt="" width="1685" height="907" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density.png 1685w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-300x161.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-768x413.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-1024x551.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-1420x764.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zh_density-920x495.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1685px) 100vw, 1685px" /></p>
<p>The most used clients are Twitter Web Client (browser) and FTTT. They are easily &#8220;hackable&#8221; and are often used to automate the accounts. This inauthentic behavior seems to be confirmed by the daily rhythm: most of Chinese tweets are mainly published <strong>between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.</strong> (local time) <strong>during the work week</strong>, the same pattern can be also noticed during the weekend, but there is a lower volume. In my opinion this pattern is a weak and failed attempt by the malicious agents to simulate a natural and human behavior.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>I have written <strong><a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/My-Twitter-World/tree/master/tweets-analysis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweet_analysis.py</a></strong> to help people who want to read and understand the datasets shared by Twitter. This script creates graphs and shows some information in a &#8220;human-friendly&#8221; way. My main difficult with these datasets has been the language: I don&#8217;t know Chinese, so I cannot read tweets and Google Translate doesn&#8217;t work very well with Chinese. However, these graphs raise many interesting points: the Internet Research Agency propaganda was based on microtargeting and well planned, there were many groups of trolls with different features to reach different people, while Chinese propaganda is &#8220;young&#8221;, maybe it has been commissioned to private companies, I cannot see a well-planned strategy like the Russian one. These data are important because they acknowledge that China wants to be a player in this game, also outside its borders &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise &#8211; and they also confirm that Twitter is still important to share information, reach the journalists quickly and lead protests. I want to thank <strong>Niccolò Battolla</strong> who is helping me to improve my script, I hope I will add some more features soon. You can find the graphs and data of this post on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yq1ks4x0zs1ea16/AAAU8Tn1fxVTdxpH4HJBUm51a?dl=0">my Dropbox</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third and last post about the Internet Research Agency dataset, which was shared by Twitter in October 2018. In <a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/about-iran-and-ira-twitter-datasets-for-fun-part-two/">Part II</a> I have focused on the European situation – especially in Germany, Italy, France and Spain – to understand if the Russian government might have tried to spread disinformation as it did in the US. In this post I want to focus on Italy and answer to the question: <strong>has the Internet Research Agency tried to manipulate information in Italy?</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/about-iran-and-ira-twitter-datasets-for-fun-part-one/">Part I</a>, I have showed that English and German are respectively the first and the third most used language in the dataset. Therefore, it is convenient to take a look at some plots about English and German tweets, since they can help to better understand the IRA schemes and whether they are also applied to the Italian situation.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">UNITED STATES</h4>
<p>The first plot shows the trend of tweets (light blue line) and retweets (green line) written in English. The first tweets in English are dated 2011, but the largest volume is between July 2014 and April 2017.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en.png" alt="English tweets and retweets trend" width="1736" height="1277" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en.png 1736w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en-300x221.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en-768x565.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en-1024x753.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en-1420x1045.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_en-920x677.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1736px) 100vw, 1736px" /></p>
<p>It is possible to see a huge change in the Internet Research Agency’s strategy during this period: between July 2014 and May 2016 the volume of tweets is greater than the volume of retweets &#8211; especially between July 2014 and July 2015 &#8211; however, between June 2016 and April 2017, the situation is the opposite. In September 2017 the volume of tweets is almost zero. This graph shows that <em>the IRA propaganda started two years before the 2016 US elections, and at that time the accounts created original tweets and media. However, during the last months of the election campaign, there was a change in the propaganda strategy: the accounts retweeted more than they tweeted, maybe to endorse real people&#8217;s viral tweets</em>. This plot provides further information on the strategy used by IRA.</p>

<p>The creation dates of the accounts who have tweeted in English at least once are shown in this plot. The red lines represent the accounts who also have set &#8216;EN&#8217; (English) as profile language. Between June 2013 and September 2014 a large group of English accounts was created, almost one year before the start of the propaganda, which suggests that the disinformation operation may have been planned months, perhaps years, in advance.  These results agree with an <a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/twitterbots-propaganda-disinformation">awesome analysis</a> published by Symantec.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">GERMANY</h4>
<p>In Part II, I have already written about the IRA propaganda in Germany, but these plots offer an insight into the volume of the tweets involved and the period in which they were written. The first plot is about tweets and retweets trend: it shows how the volume of tweets written in German has quickly grown during 2017, with a maximum in September.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de.png" alt="German tweets and retweets trend" width="1709" height="1265" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de.png 1709w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de-300x222.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de-768x568.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de-1024x758.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de-1420x1051.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list_de-920x681.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1709px) 100vw, 1709px" /></p>
<p>Why this spike? <strong>Federal elections were held in Germany in September 2017</strong>. The period between April 2016 and October 2016 is peculiar: during this time, the well-known account @erdollum was largely active and wrote many tweets in German, some of which were published on German online newspapers. I’m not quite sure about the reasons which led to the 2016 propaganda activity, but I have two main theories. Either the Internet Research Agency wanted to spread disinformation to polarize the public opinion on the <strong>Brexit</strong> referendum, or it wanted to make the German accounts realistic and trusted to use them again in the future.</p>

<p>This graph shows that many accounts (red columns) were created in October 2015 and July 2016, and a little set of accounts was created between January and April 2017. Propaganda in the United States and in Germany has some differences (e.g. the American trolls are more than the German ones, the propaganda in the US bagan earlier and is more organized than that in Germany). I don’t know the reasons, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>The US elections were the primary target of the Russian trolls</li>
<li>English is more common than German</li>
<li>Germany has fewer voters</li>
</ul>
<p>These facts &#8211; and maybe others &#8211; may have affected the disinformation operation in Germany.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">ITALY</h4>
<p>Now I will try to answer to the previous question. Italy is a unique case in this dataset because there are few tweets written in Italian by the Russian banned users, on the other hand there are many retweets from Italian accounts, mainly Italian media and journalists. The tweets in Italy are almost zero, but there is an anomalous spike of Italian retweets between March and April 2017, circa 13.000 retweets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list.png" alt="Italian tweets and retweets trend" width="1683" height="1265" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list.png 1683w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list-768x577.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list-1024x770.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list-1420x1067.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tweet_date_list-920x692.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1683px) 100vw, 1683px" /></p>
<p>In the plot is also shown a little light blue spike in August 2015, but we are dealing with a false positive: the tweets are not written in Italian and Twitter has made a mistake in the dataset. There are some errors in the language classification, but they are basically irrilevant. I would also like to point out the number of the active “Italian” accounts and their creation date.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list.png" alt="Creation date of accounts plot [it]" width="1656" height="1270" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list.png 1656w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list-300x230.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list-768x589.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list-1024x785.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list-1420x1089.png 1420w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creation_date_list-920x706.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 1656px) 100vw, 1656px" /></p>
<p>All these retweets were made by <strong>only nine accounts</strong>, seven of which have &#8216;<em>it</em>&#8216; (Italian) as profile language and two have &#8216;<em>en</em>&#8216; (English). These nine accounts were created on the same date – <strong>6th March 2017</strong> – and they started to retweet right away. <strong>These accounts were certainly coordinated and – probably – automated or semi-automated, it is possible to find a pattern both in the daily rhytm and in the growth of the tweets volume</strong>.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">1. Tweets volume</h5>
<p>The nine accounts are divided into two sets: <strong>those that were only active in March and those that were also active in other months</strong>.</p>

<p>It is easy to identify the two sets and the two patterns. Four accounts were active only in March and their hashes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>2f929662caeaa8ac1405b9eecabcae76698e805b757bec9cf0358f52f962373b</li>
<li>7a746a6b77f61084a3ee732e71a3aa436e33f463825829c7286a5203ddcd6e4f</li>
<li>8b3aa79f9434a59439dbfbf33093f1c5ef41686e4f8c75b361338a8399a6d6cf</li>
<li>372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895</li>
</ul>
<p>The other five accounts were active also in other months, they have the same pattern between March and May. Their hashes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>378410ae3ae135e4f2271e4cad9190bae2d5b029c5888114a7b0088342751a90</li>
<li>7279bc41cba54b4b5920031ecab92f4e1b806cd82980fc453d1ba97acbc036e3</li>
<li>15db31e780e1d2df7f5d8ad7ea0d3cacfde539ef93fe71572696aabc4b19ed36</li>
<li>8cf62b0d819688e71454a1997832b5e9c720bfb5a0cae070be1f2c0eb8c13792</li>
<li>f82084575688f694cdf1328a7a28bc453f3b9d0c52029ac28d55ab535b1ebb5f</li>
</ul>
<p>These two groups of accounts did not make the same number of retweets, but they did follow the same pattern, therefore I think that they are a network (or a <strong>sub-network</strong> of the Russian trolls).</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">2. Daily rhytm</h5>
<p>In the daily rhytm of these users there is also a pattern.</p>

<p>Eight accounts are more active on <strong>Tuesday between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.</strong> and <strong>Wednesday between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.</strong>. Thus, I think these accounts were all automated. Only one of the users does not follow the pattern. Their hash is: 372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895_density.png" alt="" width="816" height="428" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895_density.png 816w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895_density-300x157.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/372658464fd2be7d3c2c220eded91605f498483c984455ab63cd4ae74dd18895_density-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></p>
<p>This account retweeted many Italian tweets, their bio was &#8220;<em>Diretor e Professor Universitário. Cruzeirense apaixonado&#8221;</em>, so the account was – probably – South American, but the profile language was English. A possible reason for these discrepancies can be the choice to have &#8220;weak&#8221; patterns, in order to make the network harder to find (<em>this is just an unconfirmed hypothesis</em>).</p>
<p>There are two other reasons why I think that these accounts were automated. The first one is the user agent – or Twitter client – used by the nine accounts: <strong>all of them have only used Twitter Web Client to publish tweets and retweets</strong>. The second one is about <strong>8th March</strong> and the hashtag <strong>#MakeHerSmile</strong>: eight accounts wrote only one tweet each, one account wrote two tweets. These tweets were published in the date 8th March 2017, and they all had the hashtag #MakeHerSmile and concerned the <strong>International Woman Day</strong>. You can download the CSV file about these ten tweets <strong><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nine_accounts_it_tweets.csv">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have also reversed the hashes, and many of these accounts are also in the FiveThirtyEight dataset. The nicknames are: <strong>@rossirossivin</strong>, <strong>@AnnaRoman0</strong>, <strong>@Giovanna__Moret</strong>, <strong>@1lorenafava1</strong>, <strong>@GattiSilgatti</strong>, <strong>@VittoreGuidi</strong>, <strong>@sergio_maestri</strong>, <strong>@MariaLuigi5</strong>, <strong>@frannervia</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>All the activities of these accounts stopped in 2017, so there is no correlation between them and the hashtag #MattarellaDimettiti.</strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">MY 2 CENTS</h4>
<p>In conclusion &#8211; <em>in my own opinion</em> &#8211; the answer to the initial question is &#8220;<strong><em>No, but&#8230;</em></strong>&#8220;. Italy does not appear to have been targeted by Russia, there were too few accounts who shared Italian news and they wrote no original tweets. The Italian news shared by the trolls is various, so either there was no strategy, or Russian trolls did not know Italian as they knew English and German. Hence I think <strong>Russian propaganda did not target Italy, but there was a network</strong> &#8211; nine coordinated accounts &#8211; that shared Italian news for reasons unknown. In general, the Internet Research Agency dataset shared by Twitter is very useful to understand how a government disinformation campaign works, in my opinion the strategies used by the Internet Research Agency could work in the present day. I hope I am able to share my code soon, in my Github repository <a href="https://github.com/luigigubello/My-Twitter-World">My-Twitter-World</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all! So long, and thanks for all the fish <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f42c.png" alt="🐬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will move forward on the analysis of Twitter datasets, that I have started in December. You can read the previous post, <a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/about-iran-and-ira-twitter-datasets-for-fun-part-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>&#8220;About Iran and IRA Twitter datasets (for fun) – Part I&#8221;</em></a>. This time I have focused on the potential Russian propaganda in Europe, so I have decided to analyse the tweets written in <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Italian</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>French</strong>, <strong>Dutch</strong> and <strong>Danish</strong>. I have left out English tweets because it would have been difficult to separate the propaganda in the United Kingdom from the propaganda in the United States. In my own Python code, in order to read data I have mainly used these packages: <strong>pandas</strong>, <strong>langid</strong>, <strong>emoji</strong>, <strong>matplotlib</strong> and <strong>wordcloud</strong>. The module <a href="https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py"><strong>langid</strong></a> has been useful to classify the languages used in the users&#8217; descriptions, it is <strong>not</strong> always correct, but it allowed me to make a comparison between the descriptions&#8217; languages and the tweets&#8217; languages. You can find a list of Python module to recognize the language of a text in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39142778/python-how-to-determine-the-language">this topic</a> on <em>StackOverflow</em>. The module <a href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud"><strong>wordcloud</strong></a> allows to do awesome plots with words (thanks to <a href="https://python-graph-gallery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python-Graph-Gallery</a> for the shared code).</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE USERS</h4>
<p>I have focused on the users&#8217; descriptions because they can give some interesting information, so I have tried to answer to some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In which languages are the descriptions written?</li>
<li>What are the most common words<strong>¹</strong> and the most common emoji?</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between the languages of descriptions and the languages of tweets?</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">IRANIAN USERS</h4>
<p>The dataset of Iranian users contains 770 accounts. Most users (<strong>83,9%</strong>) have &#8216;<em>en</em>&#8216; (<strong>English</strong>) as account&#8217;s language, but the most used language in the tweets is <strong>French </strong>(<strong>35,9%</strong>), followed by English (20,1%) and Arabic (12,8%).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> I have <strong>not</strong> count the retweets, and I have excluded <span id="cwos" class="cwcot gsrt">31.594</span> tweets, classified by Twitter as &#8216;<em>nan</em>&#8216; or &#8216;<em>und</em>&#8216;.</p>
<figure style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions.png"><img class="wp-image-675 size-large" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions-1024x384.png" alt="Iran descriptions" width="1008" height="378" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions-1024x384.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions-300x113.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions-768x288.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions-920x345.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Iran_descriptions.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">On the left, the most used languages in the descriptions, analysed with langid.py. On the right, the most used languages in the tweets.</figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparing the languages of the tweets and the languages of the descriptions, obtained with <strong>langid</strong>, I have found results more congruent among them. The set of the five most used languages in the tweets and the set of the most used languages in the descriptions had four elements in common: <strong>French</strong> (<em>fr</em>), <strong>English</strong> (<em>en</em>), <strong>Arabic</strong> (<em>ar</em>) and <strong>Persian</strong> (<em>fa</em>). The results obtained with langid could be inaccurate, but they are consistent with the data about the tweets&#8217; languages. It is also interesting to see the most frequent words in the descriptions.</p>

<p>I have chosen to consider only the words with at least four characters (so as to exclude pronouns, articles and conjunctions) and used at least by ten different users (this is a <strong>subjective</strong> <strong>parameter</strong> to define a word &#8220;<strong><em>common</em></strong>&#8220;<strong>¹</strong>). I have found only ten words under these conditions and eight of them are in English (I have excluded the word &#8216;<em>https</em>&#8216;). The most frequent word is &#8216;<strong>journalist</strong>&#8216;, found in 18 descriptions, followed by &#8216;<strong>news</strong>&#8216;, used in 16 descriptions. In my own opinion it is an important fact about the Iranian propaganda: the users tried to seem credible to spread news. In addition to the words&#8217; analysis, I have also analysed the emojis by using the python module <a href="https://pypi.org/project/emoji/"><strong>emoji</strong></a>. In the descriptions of the Iranian accounts there are not many emojis, only 30 different ones, and the most used are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61c.png" alt="😜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1ef-1f1f4.png" alt="🇯🇴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, <span class="tlid-translation translation"><span class="" title="">each of which appears in four descriptions.</span></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY USERS</h4>
<p>In the dataset of <strong>Internet Research Agency</strong> (Russian) users there are 3.836 accounts, almost five times the number of Iranian accounts (well, more fun!). The main accounts&#8217; languages are &#8216;<em>en</em>&#8216; (<strong>English</strong>, 62,1%) and &#8216;<em>ru</em>&#8216; (<strong>Russian</strong>, 27,1%), following by &#8216;<em>es</em>&#8216; (Spanish, 6,1%) and &#8216;<em>de</em>&#8216; (German, 2,9%). It is interesting to compare these data with the ones of the tweets&#8217; languages and the descriptions&#8217; languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-688" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions-1024x384.png" alt="IRA descriptions" width="1008" height="378" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions-1024x384.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions-300x113.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions-768x288.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions-920x345.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_descriptions.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>To analyse these data I have used the same rules as before</strong>. The percentages are more homogeneous for IRA users than for Iranian users: the two most frequent languages (used in the account&#8217;s settings, in the description and in the tweets) are <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Russian</strong>. There are 2.384 accounts (62,1%) with English language and 1.039 (27,1%) with Russian language, the descriptions written in English are <strong>1.444</strong> (<strong>51,3%</strong>) and ones written in Russian are <strong>854</strong> (<strong>30,3%</strong>), plus there are <strong>2.178.513</strong> English tweets (<strong>41,1%</strong>) and <strong>2.839.839</strong> Russian tweets (<strong>53,5%</strong>). There is only another language present in the five most used of every list, which is <strong>German</strong>. There are 111 accounts (2,9%) with German language and there are 86.259 tweets written in German (1,6%), after English and Russian tweets they are the <strong>larger</strong> group. In a set of 3.836 users, where 73% have a description, it is interesting to watch the most frequent words in their descriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-701" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud-1024x768.png" alt="IRA description wordcloud" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud-920x690.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IRA_description_wordcloud.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a>This cloud of words is more dense than Iranian one. The most common word is &#8216;<strong>follow</strong>&#8216;, it is in <strong>203</strong> descriptions, and circa <strong>180</strong> times it is followed by the pronoun &#8216;<strong>me</strong>&#8216;. If I exclude the words &#8216;<em>that</em>&#8216; and &#8216;<em>your</em>&#8216;, the next most common words are: &#8216;<strong>love</strong>&#8216; (128), &#8216;<strong>conservative</strong>&#8216; (121), &#8216;<strong>life</strong>&#8216; (119), &#8216;<strong>trump</strong>&#8216; (103), &#8216;<strong>maga</strong>&#8216; (96) and &#8216;<strong>news</strong>&#8216; (78). The first <em>not-English</em> word is &#8216;<strong>люблю</strong>&#8216; (64), that means &#8216;<em>love</em>&#8216; in Russian. The most frequent words are in English and describe users with right-wing ideas who support Trump, but not all users are pro-Trump (e.g. the word &#8216;<strong>blacklivesmatter</strong>&#8216; is in 27 descriptions). These results are consistent with the emoji in the descriptions: the two most frequent ones are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, present in 23 descriptions, and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, present in 16 descriptions. By remembering <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/">the <strong>FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s analysis</strong></a> about another dataset of (potential) IRA tweets, <em>my</em> <em>own</em> <em>opinion</em> is that the goal of IRA users was to polarize the readers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN EUROPE</h4>
<p>My own question is: <strong>has there been Russian propaganda in Italy and in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>In Italy some journalists wrote about Russian influences in Italian politics via Twitter (<a href="https://www.corriere.it/politica/18_agosto_01/tweet-populisti-russia-voto-italiano-come-usa-f33df26c-95cc-11e8-819d-89f988769835.shtml"><em>Corriere della Sera</em> [it]</a> and <a href="https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2018/08/01/news/dalla_propaganda_di_putin_1500_tweet_per_lega_e_5s-203178628/"><em>Repubblica</em> [it]</a>), mainly by favoring the right, but with little evidence in the data. In the Twitter dataset of IRA tweets, there is the column <strong>tweet_language</strong> that identifies the language of each tweet, so I have compared the tweets written in six languages: <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Italian</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>French</strong>, <strong>Dutch</strong> and <strong>Danish</strong>. My expectation was to find a common pattern, if there has been propaganda by using these languages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-711" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison.png"><img class="wp-image-711 size-large" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison-1024x384.png" alt="Europe comparison" width="1008" height="378" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison-1024x384.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison-300x113.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison-768x288.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison-920x345.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Europe_comparison.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-711" class="wp-caption-text">On the left, the volume of the tweets and retweets for each language. On the right, the volume of the interactions (favorites + retweets + replies) for each language.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first step is to compare the volume of tweets written in these six languages ​​and the interactions generated by these tweets. On the left the amount of tweets and retweets written in German, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch and Danish. There are many tweets and retweets in German and Italian, few in Spanish and French. This information is interesting because Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, spoken by fourty million people, and the second in the world as well, so I expected many tweets written in Spanish &#8211; I was wrong. Another interesting number is the ratio between tweets and retweets (<strong>#tweets / #retweets</strong>), for all these languages the ratio is greater than 1 except for Italian. On the right there are the volumes of the interactions (favorites, retweets and replies), divided by language. The volume of the interactions to the propaganda tweets written in German is much larger than the others: to make a comparison, the second largest volume (interactions with French tweets) is <strong>almost 13 times smaller</strong>. The <strong>Italian case</strong> is interesting again, there are <strong>20.376</strong> tweets (tweets + retweets) in Italian, <strong>+61%</strong> than French tweets, but the total interactions with the propaganda tweets in Italian are only <strong>6.197</strong>, less than half of the total interactions to the tweets written in French. Looking at these two plots, <em>my own conclusion</em> is that in Germany there could have been Internet Research Agency propaganda and that Italy seems to be a &#8220;<em>special</em>&#8220;<strong>²</strong> case.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>GERMAN</strong></h4>
<p>There are <strong>99.332 tweets</strong>, of which <strong>13.073</strong> are <strong>retweets</strong>, in German. These tweets have generated <strong>121.493 hearts</strong>, <strong>74.693 retweets</strong> and <strong>15.460 replies</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-719" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-719" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie-1024x384.png" alt="German pie" width="1008" height="378" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie-1024x384.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie-300x113.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie-768x288.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie-920x345.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_pie.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-719" class="wp-caption-text">On the left, the pie plot of tweets and retweets in German. On the right, the pie plot of the interactions with these tweets.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tweets (not including the retweets) in German are <strong>86.259</strong>, they are the most frequent after the tweets in English and Russian. Among the six languages, it is the one with the highest <strong>ratio between tweets and retweets</strong> (<strong>6,6</strong>). Another interesting number is the <strong>percentage of replies</strong>: <strong>7,3%</strong> (<strong>15.460</strong> replies), it is the highest percentage among the six languages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-722" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-722" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut-1024x384.png" alt="German_donut" width="1008" height="378" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut-1024x384.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut-300x113.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut-768x288.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut-920x345.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_donut.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-722" class="wp-caption-text">On the left, the percentage of IRA accounts that are the authors of the tweets retweeted by other IRA accounts. On the right, the percentage of tweets written by IRA accounts among the retweeted tweets.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was surprised to see that Russian users have retweeted a small group of Russian users (only <strong>70</strong> propaganda accounts out of <strong>3.036</strong> retweeted users), but the tweets written by this small group are<strong> 10%</strong> of all retweets in German. I have created a word cloud with the most retweeted users (retweeted at least five times) to get a better view. For convenience I have replaced the Russian hashed users with the value &#8220;<strong>hashed_user_n</strong>&#8220;, where <strong>n</strong> is an index to count these users.</p>
<figure id="attachment_723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-723" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud.png"><img class="wp-image-723 size-large" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud-1024x768.png" alt="German user wordcloud" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud-920x690.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_user_wordcloud.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-723" class="wp-caption-text">The word cloud of the most retweeted users (retweeted at least five times).</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>twenty-one</strong> (<strong>21</strong>) most retweeted accounts are the authors of <strong>25%</strong> of all retweeted tweets and they are <strong>0,7%</strong> of all retweeted accounts. Among these there are many <strong>mainstream media</strong> and <strong>journalists</strong> (e.g. <strong>@welf</strong>, verified account of the newspaper &#8220;<em>Die Welt</em>&#8220;, <strong>@SPIEGELONLINE</strong>, verified account of the newspaper &#8220;<em>Der Spiegel</em>&#8220;, and <strong>@tagesschau</strong>, verified account of the television news provider &#8220;<em>Tagesschau</em>&#8220;), and <strong>three</strong> <strong>propaganda accounts</strong> (<strong>@erdollum</strong> and others two which are hashed because they have less than 5.000 followers). The user <strong>@erdollum</strong> was created in 2016 and had <strong>7.691</strong> followers, the others two were created in 2016 and 2015 and they had <strong>4.654</strong> and <strong>938</strong> followers each. If I increase the previous percentage <strong>up to 50%</strong>, I find that <strong>135</strong> users (<strong>4,4%</strong>) are the source of half of all retweeted tweets, of which <strong>18</strong> ones are IRA accounts. To get a full picture of the topics, I have also create a word cloud with the most common hashtags (by &#8220;<em>common</em>&#8221; I mean &#8220;<em>used in <strong>at least ten</strong> tweets or retweets</em>&#8220;).</p>
<figure id="attachment_729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-729" style="width: 1008px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-729" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud-1024x768.png" alt="German hashtag wordcloud" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud-920x690.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/German_hashtag_wordcloud.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-729" class="wp-caption-text">Word cloud of the hashtags used in at least ten tweets or retweets.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Reading the hashtags can be useful to understand what kind of news has been spread by the propaganda accounts. The word cloud confirms that Germany is one of the targets of Russian propaganda. There are <strong>8.619</strong> <em>different</em> hashtags used <strong>61.795</strong> times by the IRA users and the seventeen most frequent hashtags are <strong>25%</strong> (<strong>15.516</strong>) of all used ones. The main hashtags are about few topics: <strong>internal politics</strong>, <strong>foreign politics</strong>, <strong>refugees</strong>, <strong>terrorism</strong>, <strong>Trump</strong> and <strong>Brexit</strong>. So <strong>#Merkel</strong> is the most used hashtag, <strong>2.455</strong> times, but Merkel also appears in the hashtags <strong>#MerkelMussBleiben</strong> (<strong>508</strong>), which means &#8220;<em>Merkel has to stay</em>&#8220;, <strong>#JugendMitMerkel</strong> (<strong>265</strong>), which means &#8220;<em>Youth with Merkel</em>&#8220;, and <strong>#MerkelMussWeg</strong> (<strong>144</strong>), which means &#8220;<em>Merkel has to go</em>&#8220;. It seems that it is not important to support an idea or not, the goal of Russian users is to polarize other users on the topic, but this is<em> my own opinion</em> by reading these numbers (you might like this report by Von Karolin Schwarz and Patrick Gensing). Some other hashtags about the internal politics are <strong>#AfD</strong> (<strong>876</strong> times), acronym for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland, <strong>#CDU</strong> (<strong>793</strong>), acronym for the liberal-conservative party Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands, and <strong>#SPD</strong> (<strong>559</strong>), acronym for the social-democratic party Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands. The hashtag <strong>#Flüchtlinge</strong> (<em>refugees</em>) is repeated <strong>1.308</strong> times and the hashtag <strong>#Syrien</strong> <strong>666</strong> times. About foreign politics the hashtags <strong>#Erdogan</strong> and <strong>#Türkei</strong> are used <strong>1.281</strong> and <strong>959</strong> times each. The hashtag <strong>#Trump</strong> was written <strong>472</strong> times and there is an hashtag written in German to support Trump, <strong>#WirLiebenTrump</strong> (&#8220;<em>We love Trump</em>&#8220;), used <strong>560</strong> times. The hashtags about Brexit are interesting: <strong>#BritainInOut</strong> (<strong>459</strong>), <strong>#Brexit</strong> (<strong>444</strong>), <strong>#GoodbyeUK</strong> (<strong>415</strong>) and <strong>#BrexitOrNot</strong> (<strong>315</strong>). These hashtags are not for or against Brexit, but they are useful to create polarization. Anyway, the researchers <em>Johan Farkas</em> and <em>Marco Bastos,</em> in their paper &#8220;<a href="http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/19401/1/FarkasBastos-SMS.pdf"><em>IRA Propaganda on Twitter: Stoking Antagonism and Tweeting Local News</em></a>&#8220;, classify the German tweets about Brexit in two sets: <strong>Anti-EU Pro-Brexit</strong> and <strong>Pro-Eu Pro-Brexit</strong>.</p>
<p>To conclude this statistic I have extracted the emoji from <strong>86.259</strong> tweets. Russian users have used <strong>313</strong> different emoji, the most five frequent are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>702</strong> tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>472</strong> tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f618.png" alt="😘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>230</strong> tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>215</strong> tweets) and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>159</strong> tweets). It is interesting to notice the little number of occurences of <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, compared to the volume of tweets (e.g. in <strong>Italian</strong> and <strong>Spanish</strong> tweets there are more United States flag emoji, despite the lower volume of tweets, but there is a easy reason: <em>the Twitter dataset isn&#8217;t always correct</em>).</p>
<hr />
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></h6>
<p>The graphs for the next five languages ​​are based on the same rules and conditions as the graphs built for the German language.</p>
<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ITALIAN</strong></h4>
<p>Earlier I have written the Italian case is <strong>special</strong>, because the number of retweets are much more than the one of tweets. It is the only one with this feature among the six languages, and it is also <strong>unique*</strong> among all other languages. There are <strong>53</strong> different languages ​​across the set of all retweets, and only <strong>nine</strong> of them ​​have more retweets than tweets, but among these the <strong>only language*</strong> with over 10.000 retweets is Italian (except Japanese (<em>jp</em>) with 1.543 retweets, the other seven languages have very small numbers).</p>

It is useful to compare these numbers with others, to better understand: there are 20.376 tweets (tweets + retweets) written in Italian and they have generated a smaller volume of interactions (hearts + retweets + replies) compared to French tweets (12.636) and interactions (16.351). The situation is similar if the comparison is made with Spanish numbers. <em>The high number of retweets doesn&#8217;t seem to have influenced the number of generated interactions, by observing these six languages ​​the number of interactions seems proportional only to the number of tweets</em> (this is an <strong>unconfirmed hypothesis</strong>). It is interesting to know how many propaganda accounts have been retweeted.</p>

<p><strong>2.113</strong> different users have been retweeted and only <strong>41</strong> (<strong>1,9%</strong>) are Russian accounts. Only <strong>156</strong> tweets out of <strong>17.882</strong> were created by these propaganda accounts and then retweeted by other propaganda users. These tweets are <strong>0,9%</strong> of all retweets, this percentage is very far from the German (10,2%) or Spanish (11,6%) ones and it is the lowest among the six languages. The Russian trolls prefered to retweet italian tweets by mainstream media and &#8220;trusted&#8221; sources.</p>

Half of the retweeted tweets were written by <strong>only twenty-six</strong> (<strong>26</strong>) users (<strong>1,2%</strong> of all retweeted users), and they are <strong>all</strong> Italian mainstream media accounts. There are only three propaganda accounts retweeted <em>at least</em> 10 times: <strong>@DanaGeezus</strong> (13 times), <strong>@ChrixMorgan</strong> (12) and an hashed user (10). The descriptions of these accounts are in English and very short, and they geolocalize themselves in the United States, so <em>in my opinion</em> they don&#8217;t seem influential. Among the <strong>top 100</strong> most retweeted users, <strong>only three</strong> aren&#8217;t accounts of media or journalists. They are <strong>@carmen_piscopo</strong>, retweeted 44 times, <strong>@Elena07617349</strong>, retweeted 43 times, and <strong>@ausoloda</strong>, retweeted 24 times. The first and the third still exist, the second has been suspended by Twitter, but <em>no one is an IRA account</em> (according to Twitter). The users <strong>@carmen_piscopo</strong> and <strong>@ausoloda</strong> are <strong>similar</strong> [<em>on 24 February 2019</em>]: both have a high volume of tweets (<strong>253.000</strong> and <strong>227.000</strong>, they write <strong>141</strong> and <strong>109</strong> tweets per day circa), both retweet a lot, both have many favorites (<strong>184.000</strong> and <strong>83.200</strong>), both reply to other users. They <em>seem</em> semi-automatic or automatic accounts (in particular <em>@carmen_piscopo</em> is very <em>peculiar</em> <em>in my opinion</em>) and their behaviour isn&#8217;t so different from that of some Russian propaganda accounts. The user <strong>@Elena07617349</strong> has been suspended by Twitter, so I can&#8217;t have precise information about it, by searching on Google I have found this username in some Italian sites (<a href="https://www.davidpuente.it/blog/2017/02/24/disinformazione-migrante-si-masturba-negozio-eccitato-da-manichino-arricchimento/amp/">[1]</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lastampa.it/2018/02/17/esteri/iovotono-consip-e-bastaimmigrati-le-operazioni-social-in-italia-dei-troll-di-san-pietroburgo-r5xkcnV6d3vhllZrswINvK/amphtml/pagina.amp.html">[2]</a>), and in a paper about the &#8220;<em>networks of anti-Muslim hate on Twitter</em>&#8221; (<a href="https://rbwm.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6386/Public%20reports%20pack%2008th-Nov-2016%2018.00%20Standing%20Advisory%20Council%20on%20Religious%20Education.pdf?T=10">[3]</a>, pg. 78). This account has become viral on the Italian mainstream media sites (<em>with no reason in my opinion</em>), after its suspension, because of the hashtag <strong>#MattarellaDimettiti</strong> (<a href="https://www.corriere.it/politica/18_agosto_01/tweet-populisti-russia-voto-italiano-come-usa-f33df26c-95cc-11e8-819d-89f988769835.shtml">[4]</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.wired.it/attualita/politica/2018/08/02/tweet-russi-fake-news-lega-m5s/">[5]</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.valigiablu.it/troll-russia-mattarella/">[6]</a>).

The most used hashtag is the generic <strong>#news</strong> (used in <strong>198</strong> tweets), among the twenty most frequent hashtags there are <strong>many hashtags related to football</strong> (<strong>#SerieA</strong>, used 73 times, <strong>#Sports</strong>, 70 times, <strong>#Inter</strong>, 69 times, <strong>#Milan</strong>, 67 times), <strong>many about United States</strong>, the hashtag <strong>#Trump</strong> occurs <strong>150</strong> times and it is the third most frequent hashtag, <strong>#MAGA </strong>92 times and <strong>#USA </strong>86 times. The most used hashtags about internal politics are: <strong>#M5S</strong> (88 times), <strong>#PD</strong> (78) and <strong>#Renzi</strong> (77). The hashtags <strong>#Roma</strong> (<strong>163</strong> times) and <strong>#Napoli</strong> (77) can refer to both internal politics and football. Some hashtags related to foreign policy are the same as the German ones, e.g. <strong>#Siria</strong> (<strong>78</strong>), <strong>#UE</strong> (<strong>72</strong>), <strong>#Londra</strong> (<strong>65</strong>), <strong>#Brexit</strong> (<strong>62</strong>) and <strong>#Migranti</strong> (<strong>61</strong>). <em>In general there are many hashtags about sports, many concerning current events, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a scheme to &#8220;inflate&#8221; a particular topic</em>. The strange hashtags as <strong>#AlternativeAcronymInterpretations</strong> and <strong>#ThingsMoreTrustedThanHillary</strong> are an error, some tweets with these hashtags are classified like Italian but they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In the Italian tweets (tweets + retweets) I have found only <strong>60</strong> <em>different</em> emoji, the five most used emoji are <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>59</strong> tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f334.png" alt="🌴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in <strong>51</strong> tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in 19 twees), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in 10 tweets) and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (in 10 tweets). These emoji are also common in other languages (Spanish, French and Dutch), especially <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f334.png" alt="🌴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but (like for the strange hashtags) <em>this depends on an error of Twitter in the classification of tweets&#8217; languages</em>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>SPANISH</strong></h4>
<p>The tweets in Spanish have surprised me, because they are not as many as I thought. Spanish is the second language of the United States, spoken by <strong>37 million</strong> people (circa 10-11%, <em>source: <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-spoken-languages-in-america.html">WorldAtlas</a></em>), and is the fourth language in the world (<em>source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers">Wikipedia according to Ethnologue</a></em>). I expected to find a large volume of Spanish tweets to polarize the Hispanic minority in the United States, since the propaganda campaign was mainly against the US. However, <em>the data tell another story</em>. Unlike the tweets in Italian and German, I didn&#8217;t expect to find tweets or retweets related to Spain (in Europe), but rather to the countries of Latin America and the United States.</p>

If I exclude &#8216;<em>nan</em>&#8216; and &#8216;<em>und</em>&#8216;, Spanish is the <strong>seventh</strong> most frequent language in the set of tweets and the <strong>eighth</strong> most frequent in the set of retweets, but the number of tweets is small (there is a tweet [<em>only tweets</em>] in Spanish every 10 tweets in German and every 338 tweets in English). Even the interactions generated are not many, e.g. the interactions generated by French tweets are slightly greater. Unlike retweets in Italian, the “presence” of IRA users in the set of Spanish retweets is &#8220;large&#8221;: a retweeted account every twenty is a fake account and a retweet every ten is a tweet written by an IRA account.</p>

<p>There are <strong>1.872</strong> users who have been retweeted, <strong>108</strong> of which are Russian users. The retweets are only <strong>4.400</strong>, corresponding to <strong>24,7%</strong> of retweets in Italian and <strong>33,8%</strong> of retweets in German.

This data is interesting: in previous cases (German and Italian) very few accounts are the authors of many retweeted tweets, <em>the situation for retweets written in Spanish is different, the retweets are more &#8220;distributed&#8221; among the various accounts</em>. Another interesting data is the number of IRA users present among these forty-eight users: there are <strong>eight</strong> IRA accounts (<strong>16,6%</strong>) and this percentage is three times the one calculated on all the retweeted accounts. <em>So it seems that the IRA accounts wanted to give greater prominence to their network and their contents, perhaps in an attempt to gain influence</em> (this is an <strong>unconfirmed hypothesis</strong>). By manually checking the most retweeted accounts I have found that <em>the Russian users are actually more than eight, because some users changed their username</em>. The user <strong>@ElPaso_Post</strong>, the most retweeted one, changed the username to <strong>@ElPasoTopNews</strong>, which made it look like a local news site (it wasn&#8217;t the only one, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/628085238/russian-influence-campaign-sought-to-exploit-americans-trust-in-local-news?t=1551487963254&amp;t=1551547287632">this NPR article</a>). Also the user <strong>@MariaMozhaiskay</strong> is an IRA user, but she changed her username to <strong>@MaryMozhaiskaya</strong>. In the <strong>fifteen</strong> (<strong>15</strong>) most retweeted users there are <strong>six</strong> (<strong>6</strong>) <strong>IRA users</strong>, <strong>two</strong> (<strong>2</strong>) users related to Russia (<strong>@ActualidadRT</strong> and <strong>@bookLoverRus</strong>), a spam bot (<strong>@AffiliateBuildr</strong>), a pro-Trump account (<strong>@UTHornsRawk</strong>, probably a bot), <strong>three</strong> (<strong>3</strong>) <strong>suspended accounts</strong> (<strong>@WorldLatinStar</strong>, <strong>@oldpicsarchive</strong> and <strong>@HipHopSpace</strong>), so remain <strong>only two</strong> (<strong>2</strong>) &#8220;clean&#8221; users. I have to make a special mention for <strong>@WorldLatinStar</strong>, because it is mentioned in several Italian news sites (e.g. <a href="https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mondo/speciale-elezioni-usa-2016/usa-2016-spunta-una-caricatura-di-hillary-clinton-nuda-proteste-a-new-york_3037112-201602a.shtml">TgCom24</a>), it has been suspended by Twitter, but there is still its private Instagram account with a million followers. In the list of retweeted accounts there is also the account <strong>@Lettera43</strong>, an Italian news site, retweeted nine (9) times; <em>this fact confirms the difficulty of Twitter to classify the language of the tweets</em>.</p>

There are many generic hashtags, like <strong>#Noticias</strong> (the most frequent hashtag, used <strong>1.969</strong> times, in English it means &#8220;<em>news</em>&#8220;), <strong>#News</strong> (<strong>539</strong> times), <strong>#Politics</strong> (<strong>217</strong>), <strong>#Sports</strong> (206), <strong>#Local</strong> (<strong>154</strong>), <strong>#World</strong> (121), <strong>#Rap</strong> (46) or <strong>#NowPlaying</strong> (44). <em>The hashtags about the American elections are interesting, they seem to be directed to a specific target &#8220;close to&#8221; these elections (in my own opinion)</em>. There are hashtags about <strong>Obama</strong> (<strong>#ObamaNextJob</strong>, used 58 times, <strong>#TeamObama</strong>, used 22 times, <strong>#ObamasWishlist</strong>, used 10 times), <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> (<strong>#ThingsMoreTrustedThanHillary</strong>, used 32 times, and <strong>#MakeAMovieHillary</strong>, used 22 times) and, obviously, <strong>Trump</strong> (<strong>#MAGA</strong>, used <strong>268</strong> times, <strong>#PresentsTrumpGot</strong>, used 47 times,<strong> #TCOT</strong>, used 30 times, <strong>#TrumpForPresident</strong>, used 15 times, and <strong>#Trump2016</strong>, used 10 times). There are <em>at</em> <em>least</em> seven hashtags about the black people and the problem of racism (e.g. <strong>#BlackLivesMatter</strong> is repeated 33 times), <em>I suppose these trends were useful to polarise people</em> (especially conservatives against a minority).</p>
<p>There are 121 different emojis, the most frequent one, used in 40 different tweets, is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, following by <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f334.png" alt="🌴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (used in 21 tweets), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (16), <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (11) and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270c.png" alt="✌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (10). <em>Three of the five most used emojis are in common with those found in tweets in Italian, probably due to some mistakes of Twitter in recognizing the Italian and Spanish language</em>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>FRENCH</strong></h4>
<p>The volume of tweets written in French, the volume of interactions, and the ratio between tweets and retweets are similar to those of tweets written in Spanish, but the two sets of tweets are very different in terms of quality. Like Spanish, French is also widespread in the world, it is spoken in <strong>France</strong>, in many African countries and in some regions of <strong>Canada</strong>. However, it is less widespread than Spanish, especially in the United States.</p>

By excluding the labels &#8216;<em>nan</em>&#8216; and &#8216;<em>und</em>&#8216;, French is the seventh most used language in the retweets, behind Italian and German. <em>In this analysis I have not dealt with the temporal evolution of the various tweets, I hope to have time in the future to deepen it, in order to understand if the Russian propaganda increased during the French elections</em>.</p>

<p>The retweeted users are <strong>2.189</strong>, <strong>61</strong> (<strong>2,8%</strong>) of which are accounts of IRA, and there are <strong>275</strong> (<strong>5,4%</strong>) retweeted tweets created by Russian propaganda accounts. <em>Unlike previous cases, there are two important French politicians that are very retweeted</em> (the two candidates in the last election). In <em>my opinion</em> this is the most important fact about the retweets written in French and I have several hypotheses about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russian propaganda accounts have tried to strongly influence the French elections, by retweeting politicians as well</li>
<li>Russian propaganda accounts have used different propaganda techniques for each target</li>
<li>France has a two-round electoral system, with only two candidates. This can create a polarization and therefore the propaganda accounts have only retweeted the two leaders in the run-off</li>
<li>Twitter was wrong to classify some accounts<strong> ⁴</strong>, and there is another network</li>
<li>Other possibilities I have not thought about yet</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-782" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud-1024x768.png" alt="French user wordcloud" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud-920x690.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_user_wordcloud.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a>The situation regarding the propaganda in French is <strong>chaotic</strong>: there are tweets and users that mainly address France and the French elections and other users and trends that affect the American elections, probably because of Canada, where people speak also French. <strong>25%</strong> of the retweeted tweets were written by <strong>forty-seven</strong> (<strong>47</strong>) users, and <strong>four of them</strong> (<strong>8,5%</strong>) are in the IRA accounts list. By observing these users in detail, there are only four IRA accounts, but there are <strong>twelve</strong> (<strong>12</strong>) <em>suspended</em> accounts: <strong>@Voltuan</strong>, <strong>@ZombiaxX</strong>, <strong>@AllenWestRepub</strong> (become @GreatAmRepublic), <strong>@WashDCOnline</strong> (become @WashingtOnline), <strong>@C2017DebouCracy</strong>, <strong>@oldpicsarchive</strong>, <strong>@NOrleansDaily</strong> (become @NewOrleansON), <strong>@CarlosVFrVN</strong>, <strong>@DetroitPost</strong> (become @DetroidDailyNews), <strong>@amrightnow</strong>, <strong>@HaussmannParis</strong> and <strong>@AntiLeftistsFas</strong>. In <em>my opinion, </em>either did the Russian trolls retweet many accounts that didn&#8217;t respect the terms and conditions of Twitter (<em>trolls retweet trolls</em>), or Twitter has suspended (is still suspending) some popular accounts among IRA accounts. There is another interesting fact about these forty-seven accounts, some retweeted users seem to be related to France, others to the United States, as if French was used to make two different types of propaganda on France and the USA. In my opinion the users retweeted to spread propaganda in France are: <strong>@Voltuan</strong> (the most retweeted user, <strong>162</strong> times), <strong>@MLP_officiel</strong> (retweeted <strong>58</strong> times), <strong>@ZombiaxX</strong> (<strong>38</strong>), <strong>@Le_Figaro</strong> (<strong>29</strong>), <strong>@afpfr</strong> (<strong>25</strong>), <strong>@paoegilles</strong> (<strong>24</strong>), <strong>@gabriellecluzel</strong> (<strong>24</strong>), <strong>@EmmanuelMacron</strong> (<strong>24</strong>), <strong>@Elysee</strong> (<strong>22</strong>), <strong>@CarlosVFrVN</strong> (<strong>21</strong>), <strong>@AllAfricafrench</strong> (<strong>20</strong>), <strong>@HaussmannParis</strong> (<strong>16</strong>), <strong>@Marion_M_Le_Pen</strong> (<strong>14</strong>), <strong>@lemondefr</strong> (<strong>13</strong>), <strong>@franceinfo</strong> (<strong>13</strong>) and <strong>@ThomasWieder</strong> (<strong>13</strong>). The accounts that I think were used to spread propaganda during the American elections are: <strong>@AllenWestRepub</strong> (<strong>99</strong>), <strong>@UTHornsRawk</strong> (<strong>27</strong>), <strong>@WashDCOnline</strong> (<strong>26</strong>), <strong>@NOrleansDaily</strong> (<strong>24</strong>), <strong>@ESPEZY</strong> (<strong>22</strong>), <strong>@AnnoGalactic</strong> (<strong>21</strong>), <strong>@DetroitPost</strong> (<strong>17</strong>), <strong>@amrightnow</strong> (<strong>17</strong>), <strong>@CBCNews</strong> (<strong>16</strong>) and <strong>@darren_huxter</strong> (<strong>15</strong>). There seems to be a difference between propaganda in Europe and propaganda in the United States: <em>in France the retweeted media are trusted and known, in the USA the retweeted accounts are local media, often false, and then suspended</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-785" src="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud-1024x768.png" alt="French hashtag wordcloud" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud-1024x768.png 1024w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud-300x225.png 300w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud-768x576.png 768w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud-920x690.png 920w, https://luigigubello.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/French_hashtag_wordcloud.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></a>The wordcloud of all (<strong>2.287</strong>) hashtags confirms the point of view written above. Many hashtags (e.g. #News, #Politics, #Sports, #Local, #NowPlaying, #MAGA, etc) are the <em>same</em> as those present in many tweets written in Spanish, this fact could be an acknowledgement that some tweets in French were intended to influence the American elections. There are also some hashtags concerning France and French politics: <strong>#PrayForBrussels</strong> (used 115 times), <strong>#Brussels</strong> (58), <strong>#Paris</strong> (51), <strong>#Macron</strong> (<strong>50</strong>), <strong>#Londres</strong> (32), <strong>#ParisAttacks</strong> (24), <strong>#Marine2017</strong> (<strong>19</strong>), <strong>#14mai2017</strong> (<strong>18</strong>), <strong>#MurdeLaPaix</strong> (18), <strong>#MarineLePen</strong> (<strong>17</strong>), <strong>#Fillon</strong> (14) and <strong>#JeVote</strong> (13).</p>
<p>In the tweets written in French I have found 102 different emoji, the five most frequent are: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, used in 34 tweets, <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f608.png" alt="😈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, used in 22 tweets, <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, used in 21 tweets, <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, used in 13 tweets, and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, used in 12 tweets. Also in the French tweets <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> are among the most used emoji.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">HOLLAND &amp; DENMARK</h4>
<p>The data concerning the tweets written in Dutch and Danish isn&#8217;t reliable to make an analysis. Initially I decided to read it because I thought Twitter had correctly classified the language of the tweets, but there are many errors. <em>The errors are compensated on large numbers, but not on small numbers</em>. However the numbers of tweets written in Dutch and Danish are small: there are <strong>2.292 tweets</strong> and <strong>1.249 retweets</strong> classified as &#8216;<em>nl</em>&#8216; (Dutch) and they have generated <strong>2.009</strong> <strong>interactions</strong> (<strong>1.029</strong> <strong>hearts</strong>, <strong>890 retweets</strong> and only <strong>90 replies</strong>) and there are <strong>2.700 tweets</strong> and <strong>873 retweets</strong> classified as &#8216;<em>da</em>&#8216; (Danish) and they have generated <strong>3.173 interactions</strong> (<strong>1.500 hears</strong>, <strong>1.543 retweets</strong> and <strong>130 replies</strong>). The hashtags are mainly in English, confirming the fact that Twitter has difficulty classifying the language of the tweets.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>MY TWO CENTS</strong></h4>
<p>In this post I have worked on some data extracted from the dataset published by Twitter, I have focused on tweets and retweets written in some languages present in Europe (German, Italian, Spanish and French), on the retweeted accounts and on the hashtags used by the IRA users to try to understand if there was propaganda in Germany, Italy, Spain and France. I have started this post with a question: <em>has there been Russian propaganda in Europe? And in Italy?</em> I&#8217;ll try to draw my own conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter has not correctly classified the languages of some tweets (usually short tweets), this hasn&#8217;t helped me to analyze the data because I can&#8217;t completely trust the dataset. A good example are the tweets with the emoji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f334.png" alt="🌴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, classified as Spanish or Italian. The tweets with the palm emoji are mainly quotes, with the addition of silly hashtags (e.g. #Top), of tweets very similar to <a href="https://twitter.com/Nov2020election/status/891585241877499904">this tweet by @TerreBehlog</a> (now @Nov2020election). The tweets are mainly in English, but are mistakenly classified as Italian and Spanish.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-20/twitter-revises-data-on-russian-trolls-and-their-2017-activity">Twitter was wrong to classify some accounts<strong>⁴</strong></a>. In January 2019 Twitter has removed 228 users from its dataset of IRA accounts, shared in October 2018, because these accounts seem to belong to a different network, coming from Venezuela. Twitter has never said how it classifies propaganda accounts, but it is clear that it is an uncertain procedure even for Twitter. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><strong><strong>Unfortunately I analyzed the dataset before January 2019, so these statistics are based on the incorrect dataset. I hope the final results aren&#8217;t so different.</strong></strong></strong></span></li>
<li>In <strong>Germany</strong> it seems that the Russian trolls have tried to alter and polarize the topics on Twitter, I don&#8217;t know if the Russian propaganda has worked and I can&#8217;t quantify its effects. Germany is one of the countries where the trolls have been most active (together with Russia, Ukraine and the United States). In my opinion the best analysis about Russian propaganda in Germany was written by <strong>Luca Hammer</strong>, you can read it <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1052562207140122624">on Twitter</a></strong> or <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1052562207140122624.html"><strong>on Threadapp.</strong></a></li>
<li>In <strong>Italy</strong> the IRA accounts weren&#8217;t very active (they wrote a few tweets), but they shared a lot of information in Italian via retweets. Shared retweets come from mainstream media, concerning various topics, the political hashtags mainly concern the PD (<em>Democratic Party</em>) and the M5S (<em>Five Star Movement</em>). I can&#8217;t conclude that there has been Russian propaganda in Italy, but the large number of retweets is suspicious. In Italy, in August 2018, many newspapers discussed Russian propaganda in Italy and the FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s dataset, the best analysis (in my opinion) was written by <strong>Marianna Bruschi </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MariannaBruschi/status/1025060376830984193">[link to Twitter]</a>.</li>
<li>The tweets written in Spanish don&#8217;t have hashtags or retweeted accounts that can be connected to Spain. The propaganda target is the Latin minority in the United States and this propaganda is very different from that seen in Germany: many retweeted accounts have been suspended, many of them were trolls, many hashtags refer to the American elections, and retweeted news is written from local news sites (fake) and not from trusted accounts.</li>
<li>The tweets classified as <strong>French</strong> are very important: they are the example of different propaganda for different targets. In the French tweets there two main sets: one similar to the tweets written in Spanish and one similar to the tweets written in German. In the first one there are propaganda tweets about American elections, so there are many fake accounts of local news, in the second one there are mainly retweets from trusted accounts (e.g. @Le_Figaro, @MLP_officiel, @EmmanuelMacron and @Elysee).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to conclude these statistics by analyzing the retweets and tweets in Italian.</p>
