In my own spare time I like to participate in the bug bounty programs. They are a hard challenge, but it is satisfying to find vulnerabilities in big companies. I usually look for XSS vulnerabilities, for this reason I have written a little python script to automate the search of XSS.

**XSSSonar** is an open source tool to look for XSS vulnerabilities on a web page, it is written in Python 2.x for now, but I hope to rewrite it in Python 3.x. You can download it from the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/luigigubello/XSSSonar).

A little trick to properly use XSSSonar with POST parameters: in the source code of the site you find the HTML tag **<form>** where the POST parameters are and check if there is the attribute **action**. If so, the value of attribute is the URL to type in XSSSonar. It is better to assign default values to POST parameters to have a more precise scan.
